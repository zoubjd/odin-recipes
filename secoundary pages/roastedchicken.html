     <h2 class="sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
     <ul class="words">
          <li>6 medium bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
          <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
          <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
          <li>1 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
          <li>1 medium lemon, sliced</li>
          <li>10 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
          <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="sub-title">Steps</h2>
     <ol class="words">
          <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper on all sides</li>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a roasting pan set over two burners at medium-high heat. Sear chicken skin-side down in the hot oil for 5 to 7 minutes.<br> Turn chicken thighs and add potatoes. Mix potatoes with oil. Add lemon slices and garlic cloves and toss everything together so potatoes<br> and garlic are well-coated in olive oil.</li>
          <li>Transfer chicken to the oven and cook until chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven<br> and stir in the parsley before serving.</li>
