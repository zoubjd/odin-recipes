     <h4><blockquote> I'm making chicken pot pie in a pan, which is usually still called chicken pot pie, but it shouldn't be since it really is a completely different, far superior, species with a much higher crust-to-filling ratio, making it even more savory and deeply delicious.</h4>
     <h2 class="sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
     <ul class="words">
          <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
          <li>⅔ cup diced onion</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
          <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
          <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
          <li>½ cup sliced carrots</li>
          <li>½ cup sliced celery</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
          <li>½ cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
          <li>1 recipe pastry pie dough</li>
          <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="sub-title">Steps</h2>
     <ol class="words">
          <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Melt butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced onion and salt. Cook, stirring, until onions start to soften,<br> and the edges begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chicken, and cook, stirring, until the chicken loses its pink color, and starts to brown in<br> spots, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle flour over top, then cook and stir for about 2 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan <br>with a spatula. Stir in carrots, celery, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
          <li>Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it's as thick as you want, 5 to 10 minutes. For a thick, sticky filling once baked, reduce<br> until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. For a saucier filling, don't reduce the mixture at all.</li>
          <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the peas and thyme. Taste for seasoning and reserve until needed.</li>
          <li>Roll out pie or pastry dough to form a circle about 14 inches in diameter.</li>
          <li>Fold over 1/2 inch of dough all the way around, and then crimp the edge to make a decorative scalloped design. Cut or punch out a 1-inch hole in the center of the dough.</li>
          <li>Place the pan on top of a sheet pan in case filling bubbles over in the oven. Carefully place the dough over the filling, and adjust until<br> it's centered. Press the crust lightly into the filling. Brush the top with an egg wash if desired.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is bubbling, about 40 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
